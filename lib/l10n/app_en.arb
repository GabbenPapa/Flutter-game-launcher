		"game_darts_long_description": "Darts is a popular game where players aim to throw small, pointed missiles at a circular target known as a dartboard. The game can be played in various formats, with the most common being 301 and 501. In these modes, players start with a score of 301 or 501, and the goal is to reduce the score to exactly zero by subtracting the points scored with each throw. To finish, the player must hit a double. Cricket is another fun variation where players aim to close specific numbers on the board (15–20) and the bullseye before their opponent. Clock is a game where players must hit each number on the dartboard in numerical order, starting from 1 and finishing with the bullseye. Implementing these modes will allow for exciting two-player matches, and adding statistics can enhance the experience by tracking accuracy, high scores, and the number of darts thrown. This adds depth to gameplay, allowing players to monitor their performance over time.",

Each player accumulates points during their turn, adding the dice's value to their current score. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and the other player takes over. Players can choose to hold their score, adding the current score to their total. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game. Careful strategy is required, as rolling a 1 resets the player's current score for that turn!",

Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. In your implementation, the player will compete against the computer, adding an element of unpredictability and excitement. To make the game more interesting, you could introduce a hidden mode that unlocks an advanced version: rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. In this version, Spock beats scissors and rock, while lizard beats Spock and paper, adding more complexity and options to the gameplay. This hidden mode could be triggered by a secret combination or a special event, adding an element of surprise for players who discover it. With the computer as the opponent, you can also implement statistics to track the player's win/loss record, favorite moves, and the outcome probability for different choices. This makes the game more engaging and replayable for the user.",
